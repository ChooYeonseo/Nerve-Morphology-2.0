This program is developed to visualize the course of the saphenous nerve.  

It is an additional tool created for the paper titled **"Anatomical Mapping and Electrode Placement Guidelines for Saphenous Nerve Conduction Studies: A Cadaveric Study."** by Dong Hwee Kim, Yeonseo Choo, Seoyoung Park, Jeongwon Mun

## Abstract
This study utilized ten cadaveric specimens to elucidate the anatomical trajectory of the saphenous nerve (SN) in both lower limbs. An incision from the knee to the medial aspect of the foot enabled meticulous mapping of the SN’s course. Quantitative measurements were taken from the medial malleolus’s tip and midpoint to the SN, along with evaluations of its diameter. These findings present an enhanced anatomical framework for the SN’s path and dimensions, supporting surgical and nerve block interventions in the lower limb. Leveraging these mapped pathways, we developed a clinical guideline for NCS electrode placement, illustrated through a probability-based heatmap of nerve signal distribution. Based on this new guideline, created using our proprietary nerve-tracking and probabilistic heatmap program, more precise saphenous nerve conduction studies and improved diagnostic accuracy for saphenous neuropathies are expected.
